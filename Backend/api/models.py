# This file would contain your database models if you were using an ORM
# like SQLAlchemy. For now, since you are using CSV files, this might
# not be immediately necessary, but it's good practice to have it for future expansion.

# Example using SQLAlchemy:
# from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Float
# from .database import Base

# class Planet(Base):
#     __tablename__ = "planets"

#     id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
#     name = Column(String, index=True)
#     orbital_period = Column(Float)
