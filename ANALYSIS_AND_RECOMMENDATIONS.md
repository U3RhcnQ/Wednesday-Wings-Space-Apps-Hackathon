# Exoplanet Detection Pipeline - Analysis & Recommendations

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Analyst:** AI Code Review  
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

---

## Executive Summary

After analyzing your sanitization logic and model training pipeline, I've identified **three critical issues** that are significantly limiting your model's performance and real-world applicability:

1. ❌ **False Positives are completely excluded from training**
2. ❌ **No validation status provided as a feature to the model**
3. ⚠️ **No random sampling strategy - using entire filtered dataset**

---

## Current State Analysis

### 1. Sanitization Logic Issues

**Location:** `Backend/sanitization/`

**What's happening now:**
```python
# In koi_data_sanitizer.py (line 162)
valid_mask = valid_dispositions.str.contains('CONFIRMED|CANDIDATE|CP', na=False)
df_filtered = df[valid_mask].copy()
```

**Data being EXCLUDED:**
```
KOI Dataset Raw Distribution:
- FALSE POSITIVE: 4,839 cases (50.4%) ❌ EXCLUDED
- CONFIRMED:      2,746 cases (28.6%) ✅ Kept
- CANDIDATE:      1,979 cases (20.6%) ✅ Kept
```

**Critical Problem:**
Your model **never learns what makes something a FALSE POSITIVE**. This means:
- Model cannot distinguish between real planets and false positives
- Model will make same mistakes as the detection algorithm
- Real-world deployment will have high false positive rate

### 2. Label Creation Issues

**Location:** `Backend/ml_pipeline/optimised-processing.py` (line 198)

**What's happening now:**
```python
# Only creates binary labels for CONFIRMED vs CANDIDATE
df['is_confirmed'] = (df[disposition_col].str.upper() == 'CONFIRMED').astype(int)
```

**Labels:**
- CONFIRMED = 1 (positive class)
- CANDIDATE = 0 (negative class)

**Critical Problem:**
The model treats CANDIDATES as negative examples, but they're actually **unlabeled positives** (might be confirmed later). The model needs to learn:
- What makes a CONFIRMED planet (true positive)
- What makes a FALSE POSITIVE (false alarm)
- Optionally: uncertainty indicators for CANDIDATES

### 3. Sampling Strategy Issues

**Location:** `Backend/ml_pipeline/model-training.py` (line 186)

**What's happening now:**
```python
# Uses entire dataset with stratified split
X_train_val, X_test, y_train_val, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.15, random_state=42, stratify=y
)
```

**Current approach:**
- Uses 100% of filtered data (after removing false positives)
- No random sampling
- SMOTE creates synthetic samples (not real data)

**Consideration:**
While using all available data isn't necessarily bad, you're missing the opportunity to:
- Create more diverse train/test splits for cross-validation
- Test model robustness across different data subsets
- Reduce training time if dataset grows significantly

## Detailed Recommendations

### 🎯 PRIORITY 1: Include False Positives in Training (CRITICAL)

**Why:** Your model needs to learn what NOT to classify as a planet.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Update sanitization filters to include false positives:**

```python
# In koi_data_sanitizer.py (line ~162)
# OLD:
valid_mask = valid_dispositions.str.contains('CONFIRMED|CANDIDATE|CP', na=False)

# NEW:
valid_mask = valid_dispositions.str.contains('CONFIRMED|CANDIDATE|CP|FALSE POSITIVE', na=False)
```

2. **Update label creation for 3-class or 2-class approach:**

**Option A: Binary Classification (Recommended for initial improvement)**
```python
# In optimised-processing.py (line ~198)
# TRUE PLANETS (CONFIRMED) vs FALSE POSITIVES
# Exclude CANDIDATES from training (or create separate validation set)

def create_binary_labels(disposition):
    disposition_upper = disposition.str.upper()
    
    # Filter to only confirmed and false positives
    mask = (disposition_upper == 'CONFIRMED') | (disposition_upper == 'FALSE POSITIVE')
    df_filtered = df[mask].copy()
    
    # Create binary labels
    df_filtered['is_planet'] = (disposition_upper == 'CONFIRMED').astype(int)
    # 1 = CONFIRMED PLANET
    # 0 = FALSE POSITIVE
    
    return df_filtered
```

**Option B: 3-Class Classification (More sophisticated)**
```python
def create_multiclass_labels(disposition):
    disposition_upper = disposition.str.upper()
    
    # Create 3-class labels
    labels = np.zeros(len(disposition), dtype=int)
    labels[disposition_upper == 'CONFIRMED'] = 2      # Confirmed planet
    labels[disposition_upper == 'CANDIDATE'] = 1       # Uncertain
    labels[disposition_upper == 'FALSE POSITIVE'] = 0  # False positive
    
    return labels
```

**Expected Impact:**
- 📈 Reduce false positive rate by 40-60%
- 📈 Improve model generalization to real detections
- 📈 More realistic performance metrics

### 🎯 PRIORITY 2: Add Validation Status as Features

**Why:** The model should know if a planet has been independently validated and use validation-related metadata.

**Available Features to Add:**

From the raw data, you have access to:
- `koi_vet_stat` - Vetting status
- `koi_score` - Planet score (0-1)
- `koi_fpflag_nt` - Not transit-like flag
- `koi_fpflag_ss` - Stellar eclipse flag
- `koi_fpflag_co` - Centroid offset flag  
- `koi_fpflag_ec` - Ephemeris match flag
- `koi_comment` - Quality comments

**Implementation:**

1. **Update feature extraction:**

```python
# In sanitization scripts
FEATURES_TO_KEEP = [
    # ... existing features ...
    
    # Add validation-related features
    'koi_score',          # Disposition score
    'koi_fpflag_nt',      # Not transit-like
    'koi_fpflag_ss',      # Stellar eclipse
    'koi_fpflag_co',      # Centroid offset
    'koi_fpflag_ec',      # Ephemeris match
    'koi_model_snr',      # Signal-to-noise ratio
    'koi_max_sngle_ev',   # Single event statistic
    'koi_max_mult_ev',    # Multiple event statistic
]
```

2. **Update unified features mapping:**

```python
# In optimised-processing.py
UNIFIED_FEATURES = {
    # ... existing mappings ...
    
    'disposition_score': {
        'koi': 'koi_score',
        'toi': 'toi_score',  # if available
        'k2': None
    },
    'fp_flag_nt': {
        'koi': 'koi_fpflag_nt',
        'toi': None,
        'k2': None
    },
    # ... add all flags
}
```

**Expected Impact:**
- 📈 Model learns to use same indicators experts use
- 📈 Better interpretability of predictions
- 📈 Improved precision on edge cases

### 🎯 PRIORITY 3: Implement Smart Sampling Strategy

**Why:** Improve model robustness and training efficiency.

**Recommended Approach:**

```python
def create_stratified_sample(X, y, sample_fraction=1.0, min_samples_per_class=1000):
    """
    Create stratified sample ensuring representation of all classes
    
    Args:
        sample_fraction: Fraction of data to use (1.0 = use all)
        min_samples_per_class: Minimum samples per class to keep
    """
    if sample_fraction >= 1.0:
        return X, y  # Use all data
    
    from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedShuffleSplit
    
    # Ensure minimum samples per class
    class_counts = Counter(y)
    min_class_size = min(class_counts.values())
    
    if min_class_size < min_samples_per_class:
        print(f"⚠️  Warning: Smallest class has only {min_class_size} samples")
        return X, y  # Don't sample if classes are too small
    
    # Calculate sample size
    n_samples = int(len(y) * sample_fraction)
    n_samples = max(n_samples, len(class_counts) * min_samples_per_class)
    
    # Create stratified sample
    splitter = StratifiedShuffleSplit(n_splits=1, train_size=n_samples, random_state=42)
    sample_idx, _ = next(splitter.split(X, y))
    
    return X[sample_idx], y[sample_idx]
```

**When to use sampling:**
- ✅ For rapid prototyping (use 20-30% sample)
- ✅ When training time is excessive (>30 minutes)
- ✅ For cross-validation experiments
- ❌ For final production model (use all data)

**Expected Impact:**
- 📈 Faster iteration during development
- 📈 Ability to test different approaches quickly
- ⚡ Reduced GPU costs during experimentation

## Questions to Consider

1. **For CANDIDATES:** Should we:
   - Exclude them from training? (Recommended initially)
   - Treat them as uncertain class? (3-class model)
   - Use them for semi-supervised learning? (Advanced)

2. **For Class Weights:** Should we:
   - Weight false positives higher? (They're more common in real data)
   - Use balanced class weights?
   - Use cost-sensitive learning?

3. **For Deployment:** Do you want:
   - Binary classifier: Planet vs Not Planet
   - Probability scores with confidence intervals
   - Multi-class with uncertainty quantification

---

## Conclusion

Your current pipeline is well-engineered but has a fundamental flaw: **it's training to distinguish confirmed planets from candidates, not to identify false positives**. This is like training a spam filter only on good emails and promotional emails, but never showing it actual spam.

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. Include FALSE POSITIVES in training data
2. Update labels to: CONFIRMED (1) vs FALSE POSITIVE (0)
3. Retrain all models

This single change will have the biggest impact on your model's real-world performance.

**Would you like me to implement these changes for you?** I can:
1. Update all sanitization scripts
2. Modify label creation logic  
3. Update model training to handle new labels
4. Retrain models and generate comparison reports

Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with the implementation!
