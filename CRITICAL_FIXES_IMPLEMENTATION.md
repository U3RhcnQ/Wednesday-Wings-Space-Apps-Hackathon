## Issue 1: False Positives Excluded from Training

### Problem Analysis

**Critical Flaw Identified:**
The sanitization process was completely excluding false positives from the training data, resulting in a model that never learned to distinguish between real planets and false alarms.

**Before Fix:**
```python
# In sanitization scripts - WRONG APPROACH
valid_mask = valid_dispositions.str.contains('CONFIRMED|CANDIDATE|CP', na=False)
# This excluded ALL false positives from training!
```

**Data Loss:**
- **KOI Dataset**: Lost 4,969 false positives (50.4% of raw data)
- **K2 Dataset**: Lost 293 false positives (7.3% of raw data)
- **TOI Dataset**: Lost ~1,200 false positives (17% of raw data)

**Real-World Impact:**
- Model couldn't distinguish real planets from false positives
- High false positive rate in production deployment
- Same mistakes as original detection algorithms

### Solution Implementation

**1. Updated Sanitization Filters:**

Modified all three sanitization scripts to include false positive categories:

```python
# Backend/sanitization/koi_data_sanitizer.py
# OLD (Issue 1):
valid_mask = valid_dispositions.str.contains('CONFIRMED|CANDIDATE|CP', na=False)

# NEW (Fixed):
valid_mask = valid_dispositions.str.contains('CONFIRMED|CANDIDATE|CP|FALSE POSITIVE|FP', na=False)
```

**2. Updated Raw Data Sources:**

Changed data source priority to use raw NASA data instead of pre-cleaned datasets:

```python
# Updated file search order to prioritize raw data
possible_locations = [
    # Primary location - raw data with all dispositions
    backend_root / 'data' / 'raw' / 'koi.csv',
    # Fallback to cleaned data only if raw unavailable
    backend_root / 'cleaned_datasets' / 'koi_cleaned.csv',
]
```

**3. Integrated with Complete Pipeline:**

Updated the sanitization runner to automatically trigger normalization:

```python
# Backend/sanitization/run_all_sanitizers.py
def run_normalization():
    """Run normalization after successful sanitization"""
    # Automatically normalizes the newly balanced dataset
```

### Results Achieved

**Massive Dataset Improvements:**
- **K2**: 801 → **1,798 records** (+124% more data, includes 242 false positives)
- **KOI**: 3,412 → **8,214 records** (+141% more data, includes 4,640 false positives)  
- **TOI**: 5,127 → **7,022 records** (+37% more data, includes 1,197 false positives)

**New Balanced Composition:**
- **Total False Positives**: 6,079 records (70.7% of training data)
- **Total Confirmed Planets**: 2,523 records (29.3% of training data)
- **Realistic Class Distribution**: Matches real-world detection scenarios

---

## Issue 2: Incorrect Label Creation Logic

### Problem Analysis

**Fundamental Labeling Error:**
The ML pipeline was creating labels that distinguished "Confirmed vs Candidate" instead of "Planet vs False Positive", leading to completely wrong learning objectives.

**Before Fix:**
```python
# Backend/ml_pipeline/optimised-processing.py - WRONG APPROACH
df['is_confirmed'] = (df[disposition_col].str.upper() == 'CONFIRMED').astype(int)
# CONFIRMED = 1, CANDIDATE = 0, FALSE POSITIVE = 0
# This treats CANDIDATES as negative examples!
```

**Labeling Problems:**
- CONFIRMED = 1 ✅ (correct)
- CANDIDATE = 0 ❌ (wrong - these are uncertain, not negative)
- FALSE POSITIVE = 0 ❌ (correct value, wrong reason)

**Learning Problem:**
Model learned: "What makes a confirmed planet vs candidate?"
Should learn: "What makes a real planet vs false positive?"

### Solution Implementation

**1. Created Proper Binary Label Function:**

```python
def create_proper_binary_labels(df, disposition_col):
    """
    Create proper binary labels for planet classification:
    CONFIRMED = 1 (definite planet)
    FALSE POSITIVE = 0 (definite not planet)
    CANDIDATES = excluded from training (uncertain)
    """
    disposition_upper = df[disposition_col].str.upper()
    
    # Only keep records where we're certain of the label
    certain_mask = (
        (disposition_upper == 'CONFIRMED') |
        (disposition_upper == 'FALSE POSITIVE') |
        (disposition_upper.str.contains('FP', na=False, regex=False)) |
        (disposition_upper == 'REFUTED')
    )
    
    df_filtered = df[certain_mask].copy()
    
    # Create proper binary labels
    df_filtered['is_confirmed'] = (
        df_filtered[disposition_col].str.upper() == 'CONFIRMED'
    ).astype(int)
    
    return df_filtered
```

**2. Updated Both Processing Pipelines:**

Modified both `optimised-processing.py` and `robust-preprocessing.py` to use proper labeling:

```python
# Backend/ml_pipeline/robust-preprocessing.py
def create_binary_label(self, disposition_str):
    """Fixed Issue 2: Now creates proper binary classification"""
    disposition_str = disposition_str.upper()

    # Definite planets
    if any(keyword in disposition_str for keyword in ['CONFIRMED', 'CP', 'KP']):
        return 1
    
    # Definite false positives  
    if any(keyword in disposition_str for keyword in ['FALSE POSITIVE', 'FP', 'REFUTED']):
        return 0
        
    # Uncertain cases (CANDIDATES) - exclude from training
    if 'CANDIDATE' in disposition_str:
        return None  # Excluded
        
    return None  # Default: exclude unknowns
```

**3. Added Uncertainty Handling:**

Implemented proper filtering to exclude uncertain cases:

```python
# Filter out None values (uncertain cases like CANDIDATES)
valid_mask = binary_labels.notna()
df_filtered = df[valid_mask].copy()
binary_labels_filtered = binary_labels[valid_mask]
```

### Results Achieved

**Proper Binary Classification:**
- **Training Data**: 8,602 records with certain labels
- **Confirmed Planets**: 2,523 (29.3%) - Label = 1
- **False Positives**: 6,079 (70.7%) - Label = 0  
- **Excluded Candidates**: 2,607 records (properly excluded as uncertain)

**Learning Objective Fixed:**
- **Before**: Model learned "Confirmed vs Candidate" (wrong)
- **After**: Model learns "Planet vs False Positive" (correct)

**Dataset Filtering Results:**
- **K2**: Retained 45.7% (excluded 976 uncertain candidates)
- **KOI**: Retained 80.1% (excluded 1,631 uncertain candidates)
- **TOI**: Retained 17.0% (only false positives, no confirmed planets)

---

## Issue 3: No Strategic Sampling Strategy

### Problem Analysis

**Inefficient Development Process:**
The pipeline used 100% of available data for every experiment, leading to slow iteration cycles and expensive GPU usage during development phases.

**Missing Capabilities:**
- No way to quickly test different approaches
- Excessive training time during experimentation
- No consideration for memory constraints
- Inability to do rapid prototyping

**Development Bottleneck:**
Every experiment required processing the full 8,602 record dataset, making iterative development impractical.

### Solution Implementation

**1. Created Smart Stratified Sampling Function:**

```python
def create_stratified_sample(X, y, sample_fraction=1.0, min_samples_per_class=500, random_state=42):
    """
    Create stratified sample ensuring representation of all classes
    
    This implements the solution for Issue 3 from ANALYSIS_AND_RECOMMENDATIONS.md
    """
    from collections import Counter
    from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedShuffleSplit
    
    if sample_fraction >= 1.0:
        return X, y  # Use all data
    
    # Safety check: don't sample if classes are too small
    class_counts = Counter(y)
    min_class_size = min(class_counts.values())
    
    if min_class_size < min_samples_per_class:
        logger.warning("Using all data to preserve class balance")
        return X, y
    
    # Create stratified sample maintaining class balance
    target_samples = int(len(y) * sample_fraction)
    splitter = StratifiedShuffleSplit(n_splits=1, train_size=target_samples, random_state=random_state)
    sample_idx, _ = next(splitter.split(X, y))
    
    return X[sample_idx], y[sample_idx]
```

**2. Added Configuration System:**

```python
class ProcessingConfig:
    """Configuration for data processing pipeline"""
    
    # Sampling configuration (Issue 3 fix)
    SAMPLE_FRACTION = 1.0  # Use all data by default
    MIN_SAMPLES_PER_CLASS = 500  # Minimum samples per class when sampling
    ENABLE_SAMPLING = False  # Enable for rapid prototyping
```

**3. Implemented Command-Line Interface:**

```python
def main():
    """Main execution with command-line argument support"""
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Exoplanet Data Processing Pipeline')
    parser.add_argument('--sample', type=float, default=1.0, 
                       help='Sample fraction (0.1-1.0). Default: 1.0 (use all data)')
    parser.add_argument('--rapid', action='store_true',
                       help='Enable rapid prototyping mode (30% sample)')
    
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    if args.rapid:
        ProcessingConfig.ENABLE_SAMPLING = True
        ProcessingConfig.SAMPLE_FRACTION = 0.3
        print("🚀 RAPID PROTOTYPING MODE: Using 30% sample for fast iteration")
```

**4. Integrated into Processing Pipeline:**

```python
# Step 6: Apply strategic sampling (Issue 3 fix)
if ProcessingConfig.ENABLE_SAMPLING:
    X_sampled, y_sampled = create_stratified_sample(
        X_normalized.drop(columns=['dataset_source']),
        y_final,
        sample_fraction=ProcessingConfig.SAMPLE_FRACTION,
        min_samples_per_class=ProcessingConfig.MIN_SAMPLES_PER_CLASS
    )
    # Update dataset with sampled data
    X_normalized = X_sampled.copy()
    y_final = y_sampled
```

### Results Achieved

**Rapid Prototyping Mode Performance:**
- **Original Dataset**: 8,602 samples (100%)
- **Sampled Dataset**: 2,580 samples (30%)
- **Processing Time**: 7.06 seconds (vs ~20+ seconds for full dataset)
