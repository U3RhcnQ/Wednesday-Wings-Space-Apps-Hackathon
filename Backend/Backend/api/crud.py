# Example for reading from a CSV file:
import pandas as pd

def get_koi_data():
    # In a real application, you would read this from your cleaned_datasets
    # and handle potential errors.
    # This is just a placeholder.
    return {"message": "Data from koi_cleaned.csv would be returned here."}

def get_k2_data():
    return {"message": "Data from k2_cleaned.csv would be returned here."}

def get_toi_data():
    return {"message": "Data from toi_cleaned.csv would be returned here."}
